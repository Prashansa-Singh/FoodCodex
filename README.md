# FoodCodex

FoodCodex is a secure restaurant storing and sharing application. You can keep it to yourself by using just the storing and managing features or make it social by sharing your restaurant records.

Users create a restaurant in their collection and populate various fields, such as: dietary tags, price and rating. A user can add dining experiences to any of their restaurants to remember their dining experiences with that restaurant. You can manage your own data and update any fields.

Users are able to share a restaurant to friends and families. Users can select the fields that they wish to share to a receiver to protect user’s privacy. FoodCodex gives tributes to original restaurant record creators and allow users to know the number of times a record has been shared.

A user can choose to remove any restaurant from their collection and delete any particular experience in a restaurant. A user can also delete their account from FoodCodex’s system all together. Any deletion or removal is permanent because we highly respect our users’ decisions and privacy.

So why wait! Sign up to start storing and sharing.
